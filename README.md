# project-cf-pokedex
My first JavaScript app. My goal is to build a small web app that loads data from an external API and allows the user to view the data points. 


I am using HTML, CSS and Javascript to complete this app. API intergration is on display by calling the Pokedex API (https://pokeapi.co/). The API is being used to pull data points on every Pokemon and displayed using modals.
